# Python
  This repository is where I will keep any projects/code/programs that I have created in Python and have decided to share with the world. 

## Black Hat Python 
  As I make my way through BHP, I may decide to share some of the finished projects and create a write-up for my own and ,potentially, other people's understanding. Anyone who stumbles across this repository and would like to impart some knowledge on python, hacking or general best practise when it comes to coding is welcome to contribute.
